Design Patterns:

Using the abstract factory method design pattern helps with seperation of concerns, allows for resuabilty, and possible extenstion.I think it helped with decoupling.
I think, at least for me, the way I tried to implement it, it did not work as well. 
I think that we did the singleton pattern by creating one instance of a minesweeper game.
